# Advent Of Code 2024 solutions

A little bit of fun when I can.

These are my attempts at the advent of code 2024

IF you stumble upon these attempts then you'll need the following:

* Common Lisp - I'm using SBCL on a Raspberry Pi 5. Any version of Common lisp on any platform *should* be fine.
* ASDF/Quicklisp - A way of loading dependencies for common lisp
* (advent-of-code)[https://github.com/bperryman/advent-of-code] - This is a library of tools that I use to help load data and generate solutions etc.
